# 2024 Olympic Medals Analysis

R programming project analyzing 2024 Olympic medal distribution and athlete performance using data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

## üìä Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of Olympic medals data to uncover insights about country performance, gender distribution, and medal trends across different sports disciplines. This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills using R and the tidyverse ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **R** - Statistical programming language
- **dplyr** - Data manipulation and aggregation
- **ggplot2** - Data visualization
- **tidyr** - Data reshaping and pivoting

## üîç Key Analyses Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Identified and fixed missing values in medal codes
   - Converted date formats for proper time-series analysis
   - Standardized gender codes (W ‚Üí F)

2. **Medal Distribution Analysis**
   - Identified countries with highest Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals
   - Calculated total medal counts by country and medal type
   - Analyzed top 10 countries by Gold medal performance

3. **Athlete Performance**
   - Found top 3 individual medalists
   - Analyzed gender distribution across all medals
   - Identified country with most female medalists

4. **Sport-Specific Analysis**
   - Determined leading country in Athletics (ATH) discipline
   - Calculated France's team Gold medal achievements
   - Analyzed medal distribution by event type

## üìà Key Findings
- **United States** leads in total Gold medals among top 10 countries
- Analysis reveals gender distribution patterns across medal winners
- Athletics discipline shows concentrated performance among specific nations
- Team events contribute significantly to France's Gold medal count

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations
The project includes three main visualizations:
1. **Medal Distribution Pie Chart** - Shows percentage breakdown of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals
2. **Gender Distribution Pie Chart** - Displays medal distribution between male and female athletes
3. **Top 10 Countries Bar Chart** - Highlights countries with most Gold medals (ordered by performance)
